# NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP
## NEVER GONNA LET YOU DOWN
### NEVER GONNA RUN AROUND AND DESERT YOU
#### SHOW ME YOUR MOTIVATION

*Memories broken, the truth goes unspoken

I've even forgotten my name

I don't know the season or what is the reason

I'm standing here holding my blade

A desolate place (place)

Without any trace (trace)

It's only the cold wind I feel

It's me that I spite as I stand up and fight

The only thing I know for real

There will be blood (blood) shed (shed)

The man in the mirror nods his head

The only one (one) left (left)

Will ride upon the dragon's back

Because the mountains don't give back what they take

Oh no, there will be blood (blood) shed (shed)

It's the only thing I've ever known

Losing my identity

Wondering, "Have I gone insane?"

To find the truth in front of me I must climb this mountain range

Looking downward from this deadly height and never realizing why I fight*
